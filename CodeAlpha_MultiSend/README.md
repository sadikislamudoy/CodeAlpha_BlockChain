Project Name: CodeAlpha_MultiSend

📌 Project Overview
    This repository contains my submission for Task 1 of the Blockchain Development Internship at CodeAlpha. The project involves creating a foundational smart contract using Solidity to manage and store an integer value on the Ethereum blockchain.

🛠️ Task 2: Multi-Send Smart Contract
   As per the internship instructions, this contract implements the following features:
    1. Array Input: Accepts an array of Ethereum addresses to facilitate batch transfers.
    2. Payable Function: Includes a function specifically designed to receive Ether during the transaction.
    3. Equal Distribution: Uses a loop to distribute an equal amount of the received Ether to each address in the array.
    4. Success Verification: Implements logic to ensure Ether is handled correctly and transfers are successful.
    5. Testing: Compiled and deployed on Remix IDE to verify expected behavior.

🚀 Technical Stack
    Language: Solidity 
    IDE: Remix 
    Platform: Ethereum 

📋 Instructions to Run
   Copy the SimpleStorage.sol code from this repository.
   Open Remix IDE.
   Create a new file and paste the code.
   Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler.
